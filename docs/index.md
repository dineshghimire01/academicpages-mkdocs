Welcome to Dinesh's Profile

**Personal background**  
Namaskar/Greetings Fellow's:  
I was born and raised in Nepal, a country known for Himalaya and the birthplace of Buddha.I finished my undergraduate degree in Agriculture science with focus on plant breeding. Then, I joined West Virginia State University (WVSU)for my MS in Biotechnology. At WVSU,  I worked on improving vintage tomato varieties using Marker assisted selection and background selection. I also worked on incompatibility issues while crossing heirlooms with the commercial variety. After graduating from WVSU, I joined Cornell University for my doctoral degree. I started from fall of 2023 in the field of plant breeding and genetics. I am working on a research project incorporating quantitative genetics, high throughput phenotyping and computational biology.
